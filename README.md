# CalculatorAPP

This app is my first try at Android Programming.
Built in the duration of one night, this is a basic calulator app, as the name suggests, which can perform basic arithmetic operations.

If you wish to use the app, please download and install the below mentioned apk file, in your android phone.
```
Calculator_Varun_Release_Signed.apk
```
It is possible that license for apk might expire, in that case try this apk file.
```
Calculator_Varun_UnSigned.apk
```
If all fails, you can always clone the project and build the app yourself in Android Studio.
Thank You.
